### Miscs
- I started to play [ErHu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu) (one of the most ancient Chinese traditional instruments with two strings) when I was 4 years old, taught by my father.
I was the head and concert master of Wenqin National Orchestra of Zhejiang University, where I spent 6 enjoyable years (2015 - 2021) and made many friends for life.
